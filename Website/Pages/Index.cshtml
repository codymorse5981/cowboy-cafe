            We at Cowboy Cafe are proud to bring you authentic trail meals
            from the American West. Shake off the dust on your boots and sake
            your thirst with one of our old-fashioned hand-jerked sodas. Dip your
            Pan de Campo into a bowl of beans. Or conquer the the mighty Texas
            Triple Burger! You’ve had a hard ride - so take it easy with us.
